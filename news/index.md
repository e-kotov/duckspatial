### MAJOR CHANGES

- `duckspatial_df` becomes the main class of `duckspatial`. It
  represents a lazy, table-like object whose data is not loaded into
  memory until explicitly materialized (with
  [`ddbs_collect()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_collect.md)
  or
  [`st_as_sf()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_as_sf.html)).
  Every function now accepts this class as input, and it’s the returned
  class by default. If the user wants to materialize the result in the
  same way `sf` would do, that can be done with `mode = "sf"`
  ([\#55](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/55),
  [\#63](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/63)).

- [`ddbs_buffer()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_buffer.md):
  now has four new arguments: `num_triangles`, `cap_style`,
  `join_style`, and `mitre_limit`
  ([\#72](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/72)).

- [`ddbs_union()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_union_funs.md):
  is split into two new functions depending on the desired behavior:
  [`ddbs_union()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_union_funs.md)
  and
  [`ddbs_union_agg()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_union_funs.md)
  ([\#77](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/77)).

- [`ddbs_length()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_measure_funs.md),
  [`ddbs_area()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_measure_funs.md)
  and
  [`ddbs_distance()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_measure_funs.md):
  now use by default the best DuckDB function (e.g. `ST_Area()` or
  `ST_Area_Spheroid()`) depending on the input’s CRS. They also return a
  `duckspatial_df` object by default rather than a materialized vector.
  In the case of
  [`ddbs_distance()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_measure_funs.md),
  it returns a `tbl_duckdb_connection`
  ([\#80](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/80),
  [\#82](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/82),
  [\#103](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/103)).

- [`ddbs_simplify()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_simplify.md):
  tolerance defaults to 0; gains a new argument `preserve_topology`
  specified before `conn`
  ([\#86](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/86)).

- [`ddbs_is_simple()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_geom_validation_funs.md),
  [`ddbs_is_valid()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_geom_validation_funs.md),
  [`ddbs_area()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_measure_funs.md),
  [`ddbs_length()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_measure_funs.md),
  [`ddbs_distance()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_measure_funs.md):
  the `new_column` argument now defaults to a column name, as we now
  encourage the users to keep most of the work inside DuckDB, rather
  than materialize the result. For materializing a vector in R, use
  `mode = "sf"`. This argument is also moved before `conn` argument
  ([\#83](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/83)).

- [`ddbs_predicate()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_predicate.md)
  and colleagues: they gain new arguments: name, mode, overwrite, and
  quiet. When `mode = "duckspatial"`, they return a lazy tbl backed by
  DuckDB. When `mode = "sf"`, they return a list/matrix
  ([\#105](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/105)).

  ([\#82](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/82)).

- `ddbs_filter(predicate = "dwithin")` and `ddbs_is_within_distance`
  were calculating wrong distances for geographic CRS
  ([\#88](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/88)).

## duckspatial 0.9.0

CRAN release: 2026-01-10

Learn more about this version
[here](https://adrian-cidre.com/posts/014_duckspatial/).

### MAJOR CHANGES

- `conn` argument defaults now to `NULL`. This parameter is not
  mandatory anymore in spatial operations, and it will be handled
  internally. The argument has been moved after `x`, `y`, and
  function-mandatory arguments
  ([\#9](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/9)).

- [`ddbs_write_vector()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_write_vector.md)
  allows to create a temporary view with the argument `temp = TRUE`,
  which is much faster than creating a table
  ([\#14](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/14)).

- [`ddbs_read_vector()`](https://cidree.github.io/duckspatial/reference/ddbs_read_vector.md)
  uses internal optimizations with `geoarrow` making it much faster
  ([\#15](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/15)).

- The spatial functions allow now to have either an `sf` or a DuckDB
  table as input (`x`) and/or output (`name = NULL` or `name != NULL`)
  ([\#19](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/19)).

- The `crs` and `crs_column` arguments are deprecated and will be
  removed in `duckspatial` v1.0.0. This change aligns with planned
  native CRS support in DuckDB, scheduled for v1.5.0 (expected
  February 2025)
  ([\#7](https://github.com/Cidree/duckspatial/issues/7)).

### NEW FEATURES
